  * Authors Bob Frank, Ben Bernanke, and introducing Kate Antonovics from the University of California San Diego and Ori Heffetz from Cornell University, present a coherent short list of core principles in introductory economics and reinforce them by illustrating and applying each in numerous contexts. With engaging questions, explanations and exercises, the authors help students relate economic principles to a host of everyday experiences such as going to the ATM or purchasing airline tickets. Throughout this process, the authors encourage students to become “economic naturalists:” people who employ basic economic principles to understand and explain what they observe in the world around them.
